## Introduction 

Semantic analysis, also known as sentiment analysis, is a process of determining the meaning and sentiment of text data. The `semantic.py` file in this repository leverages natural language processing libraries to perform semantic analysis on given text data.

## Usage
To use this file in your project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone [repository-url]

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org.

Install the required dependencies. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install the necessary packages mentioned in the requirements.txt file.

To run the Watch Next script, follow these steps:

Ensure you have the movies.txt file, which contains the movie dataset, in the same directory as the watch_next.py script.

Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command: python watch_next.py

Follow the on-screen prompts to select a genre of interest. The script will randomly suggest a movie from that genre.

Repeat the process whenever you need a new movie suggestion.

## Installing Docker

FROM pypy:latest WORKDIR/app 
COPY requirements.txt . RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt COPY . .
CMD python semantc.py

Instructions to run the Dockerfile:

Save the Dockerfile in a directory. Place your app.py file and requirements.txt file in the same directory. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the Dockerfile is located.

Build the Docker image by running the following command: -docker build -t watch_next.py.py

Once the image is built, you can run the Docker container using the following command: docker run -p 8080:8080 watch_next.py.py

Your application should now be running inside the Docker container. You can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:8080 or using any other method to interact with the application.
